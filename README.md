# Semester-Project-Based-on-Data-Structures
this will contain problem based on learning's solution which will be later be given to professor
# Steps
### First of all get the dataset from
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedasimalishah/auto-pedestrians-crashes
## Step 1:
### Make a queue for the car crashes based on their time line from January to December (Day 1 to Day 31) and store day of week, crash type, light conditions, weather conditions and other necessary data.
## Step 2:
### Make three sub queues from the original queue such as sub queues storing only clear weather crashes, snow weather crashes and rain weather crashes.
##  Step 3:
### Make seven sub queues (one for each day of the week) for all crashes.
## Step 4:
### Make two binary trees to store total number of crashes for each month(use crash number as key for both ‘hit and run’ and ‘not hit and run’ crash types.
# Problems
## Problem 1:
### How to find out which day (from Monday to Sunday) was the deadliest of all days as well as which months’ Friday was the deadliest among all Fridays.
## Problem 2:
### How to find the number of rainy day crashes in every month.
## Problem 3:
### Which month had the lowest ‘hit and run’ and which month had the highest ‘hit and run’ crash cases (use binary tree already developed). Which month has lowest ‘not hit and run’ and which month had the highest ‘not hit and run’ crash cases
# Postulates 
## Postulate 1:
### Is it true that the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) when the light conditions were dark, caused more crashes than Mondays and Tuesdays.
